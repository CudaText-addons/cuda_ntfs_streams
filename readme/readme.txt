plugin for CudaText.
gives dialog which allows to work with Windows NTFS file streams (ADS).

dialog works with streams of currently active file:

- choose existing stream and open it in CudaText, like a file with name original_name:stream, ie stream name is appended to filename after ":" char.
- add new empty stream with given name
- add new stream from given existing file (store this file into stream)
- delete any stream
